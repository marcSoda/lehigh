* Setup:
- Ran sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
- Ran sudo ln -sf /bin/zsh /bin/sh
- Ran export MYSHELL=/bin/sh
* Task 1: Finding the address of libc functions:
[[./images/0.jpg]]
- Address of system: 0xf7e10420
- Address of exit: 0xf7e02f80
* Task 2: Putting the shell string in the memory:
[[./images/1.jpg]]
- Address of shell: 0xffffdc8a
- There are, however, some complications with this address that I will hit on later.
* Task 3: Launching the attack:
- Getting X, Y, and Z.

  - We need to know the distance between ebp and buffer to know the relative location of Y. We know the relative distance between Y and Z (system and exit) is 4 bytes and the relative distance between Z and X (exit and shell) is 4 bytes. As you can see, the distance between ebp and the buffer is 24 bytes which means system starts at 28, exit is at 32, and shell is at 36.

- All offsets and memory locations have been filled in the exploit program as stated above, however there is a problem with one of the memory locations:
[[./images/4.jpg]]
- The error messages says that zsh cannot find 'in/sh'. We are trying to hit '/bin/sh' which means we are missing two characters. To solve this issue I subtracted 2 from the shell address (changed 0xffffdc8a to 0xffffdc88). After running it again, we get:

- We made it to a root shell. The attack was successful.
* Task 4: Defeat Shell's countermeasure.
- Ran 'sudo ln -sf /bin/dash /bin/sh'
- I edited the provided code for grabbing addresses of env vars to get /bin/bash and -p

[[./images/6.jpg]]
- I was unable to get this to work. I am sure I added the addresses in the correct order. I believe my error is in the offset between the first arg of execv and the argv array. I am pretty sure I'm on the right track. My piazza post was not answered in time so I was unable to complete the assignment.
